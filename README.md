A Deep Learning Approach to Genre Classification

Final Artificial Intelligence class project for Shaan Bijwadia and Tiwalayo Eisape

This repository contains Python code to collect and assemble a large dataset of song information using web APIs, and the construction of a neural network for automated classification of songs by genre based on their lyrics.

Various network structures were implemented and tested, and natural language techniques capturing both syntax and semantics were utilized.
The central prediction of the study, that the combination of syntactic and semantic features would outperform syntax or semantics alone, was shown to be correct. The highest-performing network great exceeded human performance, with accuracies above ninety percent.

For a brief introduction to how the code works, please see startup.py, which contains a basic program showcasing some of the basic tasks involved with the project.
